% EXERCISE 2
% Implement the function visualizeShapeModesOfVariation.m. 
% It should visualize the modes of shape variation and play a small animation for each mode by changing the mode weight. 
% Please note that every shape created from the SSM model is a linear combination of the mean shape plus weighted shape modes. 
% We denote the mean shape with S?, the eigenvectors (shape variations)from PCA as Sm, 
% the eigenvalues as lm and the mode weight as wm.
