% EXERCISE 1
% Please note the output SSM needs to be a struct with the following
% fields (i.e. please use exactly these field names!):
%   SSM.eigenvecs  ... the set of N most significant shape variations (eigenvectors)
%   SSM.eigenvals  ... the eigenvalues associated with the N most significant shape variations 
%   SSM.meanShape  ... the mean shape in x/y form (dimensions are <nrVertices x 2>)
%   SSM.meanShapeVector ... the same as SSM.meanShape, but in shape vector form (dimensions are <nrVertices*2 x 1>)

function SSM = statisticalShapeModel(PDM,desiredVariancePercentage)
