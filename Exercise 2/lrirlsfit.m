% Create a function lrirlsfit, which takes as input arguments
%  matrix X of R(n X m) of samples and
%  vector Y of {0, 1}n of outcomes for each sample.
% Return the
%  maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the coefficients ˆB(including the intercept) and
%  the log-likelihood of that model.
% Note: Use the function wlsfit provided by us to compute the WLS fit and initialize ˆB with all zeros.
