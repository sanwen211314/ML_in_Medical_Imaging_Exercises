function [X] = mean_patch(I, a)
% =========== Part 2 c: Mean Features - Mean Patch =============
% We take a patch of side a centered on the pixel (i, j) of interest and we consider its 8 neighbouring patches
% By using mean_patch.m and a loop over the patch indexes, implement a function mean_features.m taking as input arguments
%  an integral image ˜ I
%  the side of the patches a
% Returns the feature vector
% x(i; j) = [?1(i, j), ?2(i, j),  ...  , ?9(i, j)]
% as a cell array X of size 1X 9 where ?n(i, j) is the average of the intensities over the patch Pn(i, j).

X = {};
